## Core Person Vocabulary (CPV)

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the Core Person Vocabulary.

The Core Person Vocabulary provides a minimum set of classes and properties for describing a natural person, i.e. the individual as opposed to any role they may play in society or the relationships they have to other people, organisations and property; all of which contribute significantly to the broader concept of identity. The vocabulary is closely integrated with the Location and Business Core Vocabularies.

The current version of the Core Person Vocabulary is [2.1.1](https://semiceu.github.io/Core-Person-Vocabulary/releases/2.1.1/).

This specification was produced by the Core Vocabularies Working Group (Person Task Force), following the Process and Methodology for Developing Core Vocabularies, [https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/document/process-and-methodology-developing-core-vocabularies). It has been reviewed by representatives of the Member States of the European Union, PSI publishers, and by other interested parties. On 23 May 2012, the Member State representatives in the ISA Coordination Group have endorsed the Core Person vocabulary v1.00, acknowledging the work and promising to further disseminate it at national level.
